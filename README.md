🚀 Prosperity Prognosticator – Startup Success Prediction
📌 Project Overview

Prosperity Prognosticator is a machine learning web application that predicts whether a startup will be Acquired or Closed based on key business and funding parameters.
The model is trained using the Kaggle Startup Success Prediction dataset and deployed using Flask.

🎯 Objective

To build a data-driven system that helps:

Investors evaluate startup potential

Entrepreneurs plan strategies

Reduce financial risk in decision making

🧠 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy: 84%

Validation Method: 80-20 Train-Test Split

📊 Input Features

The model takes the following inputs:

funding_total_usd

funding_rounds

age_first_funding_year

age_last_funding_year

age_first_milestone_year

age_last_milestone_year

relationships

📈 Output

The system predicts:

✅ Startup will be Acquired
❌ Startup may be Closed
📊 With success probability score
